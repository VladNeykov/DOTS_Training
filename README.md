# DOTS_Training
Small sample project made during the internal Unity DOTS training.

Used Unity 2019.1.7f1, but any recent 2019.1 or later should work. 2019.2 or 19.3 might introduce package changes, if you experience errors just upgrade all packages to their latest version.

This is a quick project created for personal learning, it does not reflect best practices, is not optimized, and will not be supported.
The project is provided "as is".

Instructions:
Open the DOTS Example scene and press play.
The dimensions of the cubes and their size are exposed in the hierarchy. The various speeds of rotation, sphere movement, etc. are hard coded.
