# DOTS_Training
Small sample project made during the internal Unity DOTS training.

This is a quick project created for personal learning, it does not reflect best practices, is not optimized, and will not be supported.
The project is provided "as is".

Instructions:
Open the DOTS Example scene and press play.
The dimensions of the cubes and their size are exposed in the hierarchy. The various speeds of rotation, sphere movement, etc. are hard coded.
